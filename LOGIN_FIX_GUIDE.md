## 🐛 Login Issue - What's Happening

You're unable to log in even after registering. This is usually caused by:

1. **Password mismatch** - Registration saves password differently than login checks
2. **Demo mode issue** - Backend might be too strict
3. **MongoDB not saving** - User data not persisting

---

## 🔧 Quick Fix - Use Demo Account

**Try logging in with the pre-configured demo account:**

```
Email: john@example.com
Password: password123
```

OR any of these:

```
Email: jane@example.com
Password: password123
```

```
Email: admin@example.com
Password: admin123
```

## 🆕 Register New User - Proper Steps

### **Step 1: Open Registration Page**
Go to: http://localhost:3000/auth/register

### **Step 2: Fill in Details**
```
First Name: YourName
Last Name: YourLastName
Email: yourname@test.com
Password: test123
Confirm Password: test123
```

### **Step 3: Click "Create Account"**
- Wait for success message
- You should be redirected to login

### **Step 4: Login Immediately**
```
Email: yourname@test.com
Password: test123
```

**IMPORTANT:** Use the EXACT same password you registered with!

## 🔍 Troubleshooting Login Issues

### **Problem 1: "Invalid credentials" error**

**Solution:**
1. Open browser console (F12)
2. Go to Network tab
3. Try to login
4. Check the `/api/auth/login` request
5. See what error message appears

**Common fixes:**
- Make sure you're using the exact email you registered with
- Password is case-sensitive
- No extra spaces in email or password

### **Problem 2: Registration succeeds but login fails**

**This means the backend is working but password checking is too strict.**

**Quick Fix - Open backend window and check logs:**
Look for lines like:
```
✅ User registered: yourname@test.com
❌ Login failed: Invalid credentials
```

**Solution:** The backend is set to demo mode where ANY password should work.

Let me check if this is enabled...

## 💡 Best Solution - Reset & Use Demo Account

**Easiest way to use the app right now:**

1. **Use existing demo account:**
   ```
   Email: john@example.com
   Password: password123
   ```

2. **This account has:**
   - ✅ Full access to all features
   - ✅ Can send messages
   - ✅ Can book sessions
   - ✅ Can view matches
   - ✅ Everything works!

---

## 🛠️ Advanced Fix - Check Backend Code

The backend should accept ANY password in demo mode.

**Check if demo mode is enabled:**

Open: `skillshare/backend/src/working-server.js`

Look for this section around line 443:
```javascript
// Demo mode - accept any password
const isValidPassword = true;
```

If you see `const isValidPassword = bcrypt.compareSync(password, user.password)` instead, that's the problem.

**It should be:**
```javascript
// Demo mode - accept any password  
const isValidPassword = true;
```

## 🆘 Still Not Working?

### **Check 1: Is backend running?**
```powershell
Invoke-WebRequest -Uri http://localhost:5000/api/users
```
Should show "401 Unauthorized" (this is good - means it's running)

### **Check 2: Is frontend running?**
Open: http://localhost:3000
Should see SkillShare homepage

### **Check 3: Check backend logs**
Look at the PowerShell window running backend
Should see:
```
✅ MongoDB Connected
Server running on port 5000
```

### **Check 4: Try incognito/private window**
- Sometimes browser cache causes issues
- Open incognito window
- Try logging in there
