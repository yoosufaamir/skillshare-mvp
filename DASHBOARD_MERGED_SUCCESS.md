# ✅ DASHBOARD SECTIONS MERGED SUCCESSFULLY!

## 🎯 What I Just Did

### **MERGED: Quick Actions + Getting Started → One Unified Section**

**Before:** 
- Quick Actions (3 cards)
- Getting Started (3 steps in sidebar)
- Separate and redundant

**After:**
- **ONE unified section** with 4 action cards
- Numbered steps (1-4) for clarity
- Cleaner, more organized layout
